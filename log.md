# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 5th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Did few easy leetcode questions after watching Striver's A2Z DSA playlist. 
Leg and Shoulders day at the gym. 

**Thoughts** I used to enjoy doing DSA during placements and now that I am placed I kinda lost touch with it. So planning to get into DSA and getting good at fundamntals of Software Engineering. Also, need to get a lot better at Flutter so will be doing all these things along with going to the gym for 100 days. So its like a 100DaysofCode and 100DaysOfFitness thing here.
